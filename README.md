# Petfinder
Petfinder is a consumer to consumer website where a user having an account can post
about their pets(dogs/cats) which are up for adoption. User can post
information/description about their pets and select the category of pet along with
uploading images related to the service. Interested registered users can directly contact
the owner of the pet by viewing the contact details.
Registered users can add desired pets to their Wishlist and even remove them from
Wishlist if they want. A user can discontinue the posting of his/her pet provided at any
time he wishes so the pet does not appear in search results of other users.

Admin user has the same interface like regular users, except that he/she will be
provided extra features for update and discontinue a post related to pets.
